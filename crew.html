        Don has been sportfishing the Chesapeake Bay for over 30 years. As a
        retired police commander, Don knows how to lead a crew and make tough
        decisions. This experienced and well-respected captain has a reputation
        for perseverance and customer service. In fishing, there is never a
        guarantee for success, but this captain rarely disappoints his
        customers.
