        $650 (6-hour trip) and $800 (8-hour trip) are the minimum base fares.
        They cover the fares for 6 passengers. These prices will not be adjusted
        for groups of fewer than 6 passengers. $80/person is added to the base
        fare for each person over 6. (Please note that there is an 8 person
        minimum for Saturday and Sunday morning charters). Customers are
        responsible for organizing their group, and there will only be one group
        on the boat per trip. The mate works for tips and a 20% tip is
        customary. Recommended Group Size: 8-12 people. Larger groups are
        welcome. Fish cleaning charges depend on the type and number of fish we
        catch. For example, cleaning charge is $5/fish for large rockfish and
        $2.50/fish for smaller rockfish. Bottom fishing trips may incur an
        additional bait charge.
